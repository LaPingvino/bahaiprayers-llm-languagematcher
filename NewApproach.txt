The primary table to work with for prayer data in this project is the `writings` table.

This directory provides the bahaiwritings dolt database and code I have used so far to
try to get my project done. The project goals are basically to match up the Bahá'í prayers in
several languages among each other.

I'll list here some of my experiences while trying to do this so you can help me out to complete the project:
- it's common that people don't understand what I'm trying to do. the common assumption and also
what an LLM is optimized to do is translation, not matching. The strategy I use is to assign a code from Phelps' Inventory plus possibly a three letter mnemonic for each prayer, which is the same across languages. This way it's not necessary to have a full collection for any language to complete the project.
- I always run into limitations of command line tools and LLMs with this huge datasets. That's why I am using Dolt. This enables acessing the data via SQL and versioning progress, so it's hard to mess up.
- I have done a full assignment of the English prayerbook codes manually. You can find an old version of the data imported from bahaiprayers.net including categories and tags in the oldest
commits of the database.
- the code in this project tried to alleviate the issues by teaching the LLM to match the way I would do as a human being. Unfortunately, the tactic to use individual LLM invocations means that each request doesn't have a lot of context, which negates a bit of the advantages an LLM can bring.

My current lightbulb idea is that we can combine these facts to apply the following approach:
- Create a reference list of English prayerbook prayers. These all already have a Phelps code and fit neatly in the old categories. All newer prayers that don't have a Phelps code yet have categories that explain the kind of new prayers they are.
- Create individual requests per language that give a new LLM invocation a structured version of the language we try to match and a full structured version of the English prayerbook with Phelps codes, and then instead of trying to match directly, we ask to reproduce a target language version of the English prayerbook with Phelps codes, reusing existing prayers whenever possible and adding newly translated versions of the rest. The result as such will have a bahaiprayers.net source link for existing prayers but won't for newly translated ones. We can then reinsert them in the database, updating the codes for existing prayers and adding the new ones with a clear "unofficial LLM translation" mark.
- Of course Arabic and Persian versions are not translations, so they should not get the unofficial LLM translation mark. But we can use this same trick to prepare the ar-translit and fa-translit versions when everything else has been done.
