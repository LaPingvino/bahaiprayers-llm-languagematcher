  LLM Response - Phelps: BH03470, Confidence: 82.0%, Reasoning: The prayer is a brief, lyrical invocation praising God’s attributes and requesting divine guidance and sustenance—characteristics that match the well‑known “O God, guide me” prayer (BH03470). Its structure, language style, and thematic emphasis on God’s omnipotence, glory, and providence align closely with the Spanish translation of that prayer.
