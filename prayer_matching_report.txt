  LLM Response - Phelps: BH03629GRI, Confidence: 95.0%, Reasoning: The provided Arabic text is a well-known prayer by Bahá’u’lláh. The opening lines translate to "Say: O my God, my God! Relieve my sorrow by Thy bounty and Thy generosity, and dispel my grief by Thy sovereignty and Thy power." The central theme of the prayer is the removal of sorrow, grief, and difficulties. The Phelps code BH03629GRI corresponds to a prayer by Bahá’u’lláh (indicated by the "BH" prefix) and is named "GRI" (likely for "Grief"). This aligns perfectly with the content and authorship of the provided prayer text.
