RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. AUTOMATED PROCESSING (Low effort, medium value):
   - Review and fix 201 entries with bad UUIDs
   - These might be recoverable with database queries

2. MANUAL REVIEW (Medium effort, high value):
   - 242 prayers with 2-3 candidates
   - These are relatively easy to match manually
   - Could be processed in batches by language

3. NEW_TRANSLATION ENTRIES (1408 prayers):
   - These are non-English prayers with no English equivalent
   - Options:
     a) Verify they truly have no English match (search by content)
     b) Assign to generic codes (AB00527, etc.)
     c) Create new Phelps codes if they're unique prayers
     d) Mark as untranslated and skip

4. HIGH COMPLEXITY (88 prayers with 4+ candidates):
   - These need deep semantic analysis or native speaker review
   - Consider:
     a) Using LLM to narrow down candidates
     b) Manual expert review
     c) Skipping for now and focusing on higher-confidence matches

5. USER'S SUGGESTION TO INVESTIGATE:
   - "Some languages might have another language in the text field for reference"
   - Check if prayers contain multilingual content that could aid matching
